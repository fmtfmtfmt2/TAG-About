				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8PFq7Kg.jpg" title="source: imgur.com"; align="left"; id="badge"; style="width:280px" />In January 2013, I learned about a youth volunteering opportunity, available to kids aged 11 to 18, at the Dallas Zoo. I thought it was a wonderful chance to strengthen my love for animals and to gain <span>independence, responsibility, and communication skills.</span> So, I applied, was interviewed, and accepted into the <a href=”http://fmtfmtfmt2.github.io/TAG-Junior-Zookeeper/ ><span>Junior Zookeeper</span></a> program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the unique things about volunteering at the Dallas Zoo are<img id="chimp"; style= "height:200px"; align="right"; src="http://aboutpj.com/wp-content/uploads/DallasZooMay2014-156.jpg" /> the <span>"Behind the Scenes tours"</span>. Every other week, we are taken behind the scenes of an exhibit, such as the Reptile House or the Chimpanzee exhibit (my personal favorite), or location, such as the Animal Hospital and the Animal Dietary Center. On the weeks that we don't go on tours, the youth volunteers do an <span>educational activity</span> that relates to animal conservation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love volunteering at the zoo because I enjoy working with animals, I believe that animal conservation is very important and needs to be implemented in our everyday lives, and I appreciate the skills that one aquires as a byproduct of working at the Zoo.  I have volunteered at the zoo for <span>3 years</span>. Each year, for about 10 Saturdays in the fall, I go to the zoo and volunteer from 11:30AM to 4:00PM. In total, I have <span>110.63 community service hours</span>, an accomplishment that I am very proud of.

				I have provided a <span>recommendation letter</span> below, written by one of the volunteer coordinators, to offer a wider perspective of the youth volunteer program and an evaluation of my volunteer work.
